                                <p>
                                    my name fidaa rn and raised in villages called nahf
                                    ,situated on Upper Galilee in palestine. my wonderment of the
                                    natural world began at young age. As child. filled with hike with
                                    friends across the prairies and beyond helped to instill the
                                    confidence I have in the outdoors, and the deep appreciation that I
                                    hold for our natural world and its preservation. Despite photography
                                    having been a big part of my life for many years, I followed a
                                    different path after high school and chosareer as a
                                    physiotherapist in italy.And although physiotherapy has been very
                                    rewarding to me, but my true passion lies in photographing the
                                    beauty of nature. The joy and freedom I feel in the outdoors gives
                                    me happiness, and my heart tells me that creating art is what I was
                                    meant to do. Landscape photography has enriched my life in countless
                                    ways; my self-taught exploration with the camera has gave me the
                                    circle of joy magically combining my love of nature and the creation
                                    of art the god gave to us in this world. It is very liberating to
                                    capture a fleeting moment iing like
                                    witnessing a burning sunrise or gazing up at the stars with fresh
                                    air in your lungs to help de-stress and reconnect with this amazing
                                    planet that we call home. At some time in life you have crossroads
                                    that are presented to you or thrust upon you. I really believe that
                                    true happiness is about following your passion.and i decided that I
                                    wanted to experience the place I love so much more - the great
                                    outdoors.

                                    There are always two people in every picture: the photographer and
                                    the viewer - ansel adams. My passion is taking photos of landscapes
                                    and I have been fortunate enough to travel to many fantastic places
                                    with my all time favourite being dolomites. I find it so rewarding
                                    when you get that picture that captures the weather, or the ever
                                    changing state of the environment. You really do capture aoment
                                    in time Landscape photography is so enjoyable to me as the next
                                    time you go on a walk or take your camera on a specific location you
                                    just do know what you may capture.
